# wsHook
#### Easily intercept and modify WebSocket requests and message events.


#### ToDo
Figure out if we still need immutable MessageEvent

## Usage

#### 1. Download and include `wsHook.js` in your WebSocket client

```html
<script src='wsHook.js'></script>
```

#### 2. Define the `before` and `after` hooks
Define your custom `before` and `after` hooks on the globally exposed `wsHook` object.

```javascript
wsHook.before = function(data, url, wsObject) {
    console.log("Sending message to " + url + " : " + data);
}

// Make sure your program calls `wsClient.onmessage` event handler somewhere.
wsHook.after = function(messageEvent, url, wsObject) {
    console.log("Received message from " + url + " : " + messageEvent.data);
    return messageEvent;
}

// if you do not want to propagate the MessageEvent further down, just return null
wsHook.after = function(messageEvent, url, wsObject) {
 console.log("Received message from " + url + " : " + messageEvent.data);
 // This example can ping-pong forever, so maybe use some conditions
 wsObject.send("Intercepted and sent again")
 return null;
}

// if you want to do something asynchronous 
wsHook.after = function(messageEvent, url, wsObject) {
    console.log("Received message from " + url + " : " + messageEvent.data);
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        // do something asynchronous here
        resolve(messageEvent)
    });
}
```

#### 3. Let your program play with WebSockets
```javascript
var wsClient = new WebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.org");

wsClient.onopen = function() {
    wsClient.send("Echo this");
}

wsClient.onmessage = function(e){
  console.log(e);
}
```
## API
### `wsHook.before` - function(data, url, wsObject):
Invoked just before calling the actual WebSocket's `send()` method.

This method must return `data` which can be modified as well.

### `wsHook.after` - function(event, url, wsObject):
Invoked just after receiving the `MessageEvent` from the WebSocket server and before calling the WebSocket's `onmessage` Event Handler.

This method must return `event` whose properties can be modified as well. You might be interested in modiying, `event.data` or `event.origin` usually.

The `wsObject` refers to the corresponding `WebSocket` object used. You can use this to send a message to the server. This allows one to fully hijack the WebSocket connection programatically. 

If you do not want the user's original `onmessage` event handler to be called, just return `null`.

## Example

```javascript
// Load wsHook.js
// Define the 'before' and 'after' hooks as you wish.

wsHook.before = function(data, url, wsObject){
  data += "_modified";
  console.log("Modifying data to " + data);
  return data;
}

var wsClient = new WebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.org");
wsClient.onopen = function() {
  wsClient.send("Echo this");
}
wsClient.onmessage = function(e){
  console.log(e);
}

```
